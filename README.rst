Algorithm list
==============

1. 3 Sum

   Given an array of N integers, find pairs of three elements with the sum of X.

2. Merge 2 sorted linked lists

3. Given a paragraph and a list of words, find the word that occurs the most
   times in the paragraph and is not in the list of words

4. Implement Min Stack (push, pop, top, and min)

5. Reorder logs
   
   You have an array of logs. Each log is a space-delimited string of words. For each log, the first word in each log is an alphanumeric identifier.

   Then, either:
   
   * Each word after the identifier will consist only of lowercase letters, or;
   * Each word after the identifier will consist only of digits.
   
   We will call these two varieties of logs letter-logs and digit-logs.
   It is guaranteed that each log has at least one word after its identifier.
   
   Reorder the logs so that all of the letter-logs come before any digit-log.
   
   * The letter-logs are ordered lexicographically ignoring identifiers, with the identifier used in case of ties.
   * The digit-logs should be put in their original order.

6. Kth largest element in a stream in linear time.
